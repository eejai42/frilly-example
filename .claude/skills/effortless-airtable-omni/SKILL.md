# Airtable OMNI — For Non-Scalar Schema Changes Only

> Not sure if this project is Airtable-connected? Run the "Is this an Airtable
> project?" check in `effortless-airtable` first. If it isn't, this skill doesn't
> apply — the project is Rulebook-First and edits go to the hub directly.

> **Load-bearing axiom: OMNI is an escape hatch, not the default.**
> Most Airtable work goes through the REST API (see `effortless-airtable`).
> Reach for OMNI only when the API can't do the thing — formula fields,
> lookups, rollups, or a new table that needs a `Name` formula.

## When to Use OMNI vs the API

OMNI is an **escape hatch**, not the default. Most Airtable work goes through the API directly (see `effortless-airtable` skill). OMNI is only needed for operations the API cannot perform.

### Use the Airtable API directly for:
- **Scalar field changes** — adding/modifying singleLineText, number, checkbox, singleSelect, multipleSelects, date, dateTime, email, url, multilineText, multipleRecordLinks (FKs)
- **All CRUD operations** — creating, reading, updating, deleting records
- **Field renaming and descriptions**
- **Anything in the `effortless-airtable` skill**

### Use OMNI (this skill) ONLY for:
- **Formula fields** — cannot be created or modified via API
- **Lookup fields** — cannot be created via API
- **Rollup fields** — cannot be created via API
- **New table creation** — because every ERB table needs a Name formula (`SUBSTITUTE(LOWER({LabelField}), " ", "-")`) which requires OMNI

**Rule of thumb:** If the field type is in the Airtable REST API's `POST /fields` endpoint, use the API. If not, use OMNI.

---

## The Name Formula Pattern

Every ERB table's first field is `Name` — a formula that creates a lowercase, dash-separated compound key from the human-readable label field:

```
SUBSTITUTE(LOWER({DisplayName}), " ", "-")
```

For multi-source keys, nest SUBSTITUTE for special characters:
```
LOWER(SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE({DisplayName}, " ", "-"), "/", "-"), "&", "-"))
```

If the label field is itself computed (e.g., `CONCATENATE({FirstName}, " ", {LastName})`), inline it:
```
LOWER(SUBSTITUTE(CONCATENATE({FirstName}, " ", {LastName}), " ", "-"))
```

This formula **can only be created via OMNI** — the API does not support formula field creation.

---

## Two Interaction Modes

### Mode 1: Human-in-the-Loop (Generate Prompts)

Generate OMNI prompts for the user to paste manually. Use when the user wants to review before executing, or when Playwright isn't available.

**Always split into two files:**

**`OMNI-PROMPT-PART1.md`** — New tables with raw fields + linked records + Name formula only:
```markdown
## Table: {TableName}

**Description:** {one-liner}

**Name formula:** `LOWER(SUBSTITUTE({DisplayName}, " ", "-"))`

### Fields
- **{FieldName}** ({type}): {description}
- **{FKField}** (Link to another record -> {TargetTable}): {description}
```

Exclude: `{Table}Id` fields, formula fields (other than Name), lookups, rollups.

**`OMNI-PROMPT-PART2.md`** — Lookups and formulas, broken up by table (OMNI works on one table at a time):
```markdown
## {TableName} — Computed Fields

### Lookups
- **{FieldName}** (Lookup): Through `{LinkedRecordField}` -> {TargetTable}.`{TargetField}`

### Formulas
- **{FieldName}** (Formula): `{AirtableFormulaExpression}`
```

DAG order within Part 2: raw-field formulas first, then lookups, then formulas that depend on lookups.

End Part 2 with an exclusion table for MANY-side rollups that were omitted.

### Mode 2: Playwright-Driven (Automated)

Launch a headed Chrome browser and drive OMNI directly. Use for automated execution of computed-field creation.

This skill includes a bundled script: **`omni-send.mjs`** (in the same directory as this SKILL.md).

#### Prerequisites

Before `omni-send.mjs` will run end-to-end, all of these must be true:

1. **Node 18+ on PATH.** The script uses ESM (`.mjs`) and modern syntax.
   `node --version` should report ≥ 18. If the user is still on Node 16,
   point them at `effortless-cli` — the same Node 20 guidance applies.
2. **Playwright + a Chromium browser.** Project-local install is preferred so
   the script runs reliably from the skill's own directory (see "Usage" for
   where that is):
   ```bash
   npx playwright --version 2>/dev/null \
     || { npm install -D playwright && npx playwright install chromium; }
   ```
   If you'd rather install globally, `npm i -g playwright && npx playwright install chromium`
   is fine — just be aware that some `npm` configurations restrict global installs.
3. **A headed display.** The script launches Chrome **headed** on purpose —
   the user logs in once and inspects what OMNI is doing afterwards. On a
   headless server (CI, remote SSH), it will fail or hang waiting for
   interaction. macOS / Linux desktops / WSLg are the supported environments.
4. **A persistent profile dir.** Default is `/tmp/airtable-omni-profile`.
   The first run requires the user to log in to Airtable manually inside that
   browser session; subsequent runs reuse the same profile and skip login.
   Never delete that directory unless the user has explicitly asked to log out.
5. **Network access to airtable.com.** The script navigates to
   `https://airtable.com/<baseId>` and times out (with a debug screenshot)
   if Airtable is blocked or auth-walled.
6. **A valid Airtable base id.** Pull from `effortless.json`:
   ```bash
   cat effortless.json | jq -r '.ProjectSettings[] | select(.Name == "baseId") | .Value'
   ```

If any of these are missing, **stop and tell the user** before running the
script — OMNI failures with broken prerequisites usually waste an entire
debug cycle.

#### Getting the Base ID

```bash
cat effortless.json | jq -r '.ProjectSettings[] | select(.Name == "baseId") | .Value'
```

#### Usage

The script is `omni-send.mjs`, shipped next to this SKILL.md. Where that is
depends on how the suite was installed — as the `effortless` plugin
(`$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/effortless-airtable-omni/`) or via the legacy
`install.sh` (`~/.claude/skills/effortless-airtable-omni/`). Resolve it once:

```bash
OMNI="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:+$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/effortless-airtable-omni/omni-send.mjs}"
[ -f "$OMNI" ] || OMNI=$(find ~/.claude/skills ~/.claude/plugins -path '*effortless-airtable-omni/omni-send.mjs' 2>/dev/null | head -1)
```

Then invoke it with:

```bash
# First run — log in to Airtable (session persists at /tmp/airtable-omni-profile)
node "$OMNI" <baseId> --login

# Send a prompt to OMNI
node "$OMNI" <baseId> 'Add a Formula field called "Name" with formula: LOWER(SUBSTITUTE({DisplayName}, " ", "-"))'

# Take a screenshot of current Airtable state
node "$OMNI" <baseId> --screenshot
```

**Output convention:**
- **stdout** — OMNI's response text (or screenshot path). This is what Claude should read.
- **stderr** — progress/debug logging. Not parsed, just for visibility.
- **Exit 0** — success. **Exit 1** — error. **Exit 2** — login required.

The script leaves the browser open after each prompt so the user can inspect. Kill it with Ctrl+C or `pkill -f omni-send` before sending the next prompt.

#### How It Works

1. Launches a **headed** Chrome with a persistent profile (login survives across runs)
2. Navigates to `https://airtable.com/<baseId>` (uses `domcontentloaded` — Airtable never reaches `networkidle`)
3. Opens OMNI via `[aria-label*="Omni"]` or `[aria-label*="AI"]`
4. Sends the prompt via `textarea[placeholder*="Ask"]`
5. Auto-clicks confirmation buttons (`button:has-text("Yes,")`) if OMNI asks
6. Polls for response stability (3 seconds of no change = done)
7. Outputs response to stdout, saves screenshot to `omni-result.png`

#### Confirmed Selectors (as of 2026-04)

| Element | Selector | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| OMNI button | `[aria-label*="Omni"]` or `[aria-label*="AI"]` | Left sidebar |
| OMNI input | `textarea[placeholder*="Ask"]` | The prompt textarea |
| Confirmation | `button:has-text("Yes,")` | OMNI asks before schema changes |

These **will drift** as Airtable's UI evolves. When they break, the script dumps visible elements and saves a debug screenshot — adapt from there.

#### Granular Strategy for Computed Fields

Send one computed field at a time. More reliable than batching:

```bash
# Formula
node "$OMNI" $BASE_ID \
  'For the table "Orders", add a Formula field called "Name" with formula: LOWER(SUBSTITUTE({OrderNumber}, " ", "-"))'

# Lookup
node "$OMNI" $BASE_ID \
  'For the table "Orders", add a Lookup field called "CustomerEmail" that looks up "Email" through the "Customer" linked record.'
```

Workflow:
1. Get the base ID from `effortless.json`
2. Ensure login: `node omni-send.mjs <baseId> --login`
3. Send one field request at a time
4. Read stdout for OMNI's response, verify success
5. Kill the browser, send the next field
6. Repeat

#### Important Rules

1. **Never automate Airtable login** — the user handles it via the persistent profile
2. **Always headed** — the user must see and be able to intervene
3. **Selectors will break** — the script dumps debug info when they do; adapt accordingly
4. **Leave the browser open** — the user may want to inspect
5. **Rate limits** — kill and re-launch between prompts; 2-3 second natural delay
6. **Always run `effortless build` after Airtable changes** — after any OMNI operation that modifies Airtable schema, run `effortless build` so the Airtable spoke is pulled into the rulebook hub and downstream output spokes are regenerated. **Exception:** skip the build if you are in the middle of a batch of changes mirroring rulebook updates back to Airtable (reverse-sync) — in that case, wait until all Airtable changes are complete, then build once at the end.

## Airtable Formula Syntax

| Pattern | Airtable Syntax |
|---------|----------------|
| Field reference | `{FieldName}` (single braces) |
| Not equal | `!=` (not `<>`) |
| Blank check | `{Field} = BLANK()` (not `ISBLANK()`) |
| Date difference | `DATETIME_DIFF({Date1}, {Date2}, 'days')` |
| String concat | `CONCATENATE()` or `&` |
| No `=` prefix | Formulas do NOT start with `=` |
| TODAY | `TODAY()` works |
| Boolean logic | `AND()`, `OR()`, `NOT()`, `IF()` all work |

## ERB Field Rules for OMNI Prompts

1. **Table names are PascalCase** — `ShaclShapes`, NOT `shacl_shapes`
2. **`Name` is ALWAYS the first field** — formula: `SUBSTITUTE(LOWER({LabelField}), " ", "-")`
3. **`DisplayName` (or `Title`/`Label`)** comes next — the human-readable identifier
4. **NEVER include `{Entity}Id` fields** — surrogate keys are managed off-screen
5. **Links use singular PascalCase**: `Schema | link:SDCSchemas`
6. **Boolean fields MUST be specified as Checkbox type** — when telling OMNI to create a boolean/true-false field, always say "Checkbox field", never just "boolean". Example: `Add a Checkbox field called "IsActive"` (not `Add a boolean field called "IsActive"`). Airtable's native type for booleans is Checkbox.
