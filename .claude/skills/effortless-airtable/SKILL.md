# Airtable — One Optional Spoke (Sibling to Excel / Notion)

In ERB, **`effortless-rulebook.json` is the hub / single source of truth.** The
recommended best practice is **Rulebook-First**: edits go to the hub (LLM-direct
or hand-edits) and `effortless build` projects everything downstream. Airtable is
**one optional editing surface** — a peer of Excel, Notion, and other input
surfaces, not the center of the framework. Most teams that want a human-friendly
grid keep it **downstream** (mirrored via `rulebook-to-airtable`) for
review/validate/QA; it only becomes an *input* spoke when the project has
*explicitly opted in*.

This skill is the canonical home for the Airtable-API mechanics — key
resolution, the `-account airtable` flag, scalar field/table/CRUD calls. Other
skills point here rather than repeating it.

## Is this an Airtable project?

A project is Airtable-connected as an **input spoke** only if **both** of these
are true in `effortless.json`:

1. `ProjectSettings` has a `baseId` entry with a real Airtable base ID
   (`appXXXXXXXX...`), AND
2. `ProjectTranspilers` has an `airtable-to-rulebook` entry with
   `IsDisabled: false` (or no `IsDisabled` field at all — defaults to enabled).

Quick check:

```bash
python3 - <<'PY'
import json
with open("effortless.json") as f: cfg = json.load(f)
base_id = next((s["Value"] for s in cfg.get("ProjectSettings", []) if s.get("Name") == "baseId"), None)
a2r = next((t for t in cfg.get("ProjectTranspilers", []) if t.get("Name") == "airtable-to-rulebook"), None)
a2r_enabled = a2r is not None and not a2r.get("IsDisabled", False)
print(f"baseId: {base_id!r}")
print(f"airtable-to-rulebook enabled: {a2r_enabled}")
print(f"=> Airtable-connected: {bool(base_id) and a2r_enabled}")
PY
```

**If both are true → Airtable is a live input spoke. This skill applies.**

**If either is false → Rulebook-First project.** Don't reach for the Airtable
API for schema/data edits — edit `effortless-rulebook.json` directly (see
`effortless-workflow`). Airtable may still be wired as a *downstream* spoke
(`rulebook-to-airtable` only), but in that direction it's an output, not an
input — never edit Airtable first, because `effortless build` will overwrite
your edits with whatever the hub says.

This skill covers the **Airtable input spoke** specifically: how to read/write
Airtable via its API so that `effortless build` picks up your changes into the
hub.

**Airtable-spoke flow:** Edit Airtable → `effortless build` → `airtable-to-rulebook` updates the hub → downstream transpilers regenerate every output spoke (Postgres, etc.).

**Reverse-sync flow:** Edit `effortless-rulebook.json` directly, then push back to Airtable via `effortless build -id` from the `push-to-airtable/` subfolder. Use when the hub is being edited directly but you still want Airtable mirrored.

**In either direction, always ask the user for permission before modifying the rulebook or Airtable.**

## Getting the API Key

**IMPORTANT: Always check the environment variable FIRST — do not grep config files or search the filesystem before trying this.**

```bash
echo "$AIRTABLE_API_KEY"
```

If `AIRTABLE_API_KEY` is set and non-empty, use it immediately. Only if it is empty, fall back in this order:
1. `~/.ssotme/ssotme.key` → parse JSON → `APIKeys.airtable`
2. `effortless.json` → `ProjectSettings` → `_apikey_`

### Reading from `~/.ssotme/ssotme.key`

The file is JSON:
```json
{
  "EmailAddress": "user@example.com",
  "Secret": "...",
  "APIKeys": {
    "airtable": "patXXXXXXXX.XXXXXXXX"
  }
}
```

Extract the key:
```bash
cat ~/.ssotme/ssotme.key | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['APIKeys']['airtable'])"
```

### Setting the API Key

```bash
effortless -setAccountAPIKey airtable=patXXXXXXXX.XXXXXXXX
```

This stores the key in `~/.ssotme/ssotme.key` under `APIKeys.airtable`.

### The `-account airtable` Flag

When using effortless CLI transpilers that talk to Airtable, **always pass `-account airtable`**. This tells the CLI to send the API key configured in `~/.ssotme/ssotme.key`:

```bash
effortless airtable-to-rulebook -o effortless-rulebook.json -account airtable
effortless rulebook-to-airtable -i ../effortless-rulebook.json -account airtable
```

### `effortless.env`

An `effortless.env` file in the project root can also store keys as environment variables (standard dotenv format). This is an alternative for project-scoped secrets.

## Getting the Base ID

The Airtable base ID for the project is stored in the project settings file (`effortless.json`) as `baseId`:

```bash
cat effortless.json | python3 -c "import sys,json; d=json.load(sys.stdin); print(next(s['Value'] for s in d['ProjectSettings'] if s['Name']=='baseId'))"
```

This base ID is shared across all airtable-facing tools and should always be read from here.

## Making Schema Changes via the Airtable Spoke

When this project is Airtable-connected AND you're choosing to use that spoke, schema
changes flow Airtable → hub → output spokes. (If the project isn't Airtable-connected,
or rulebook-direct is more practical, see `effortless-workflow`.)

1. **Get the base ID** from `effortless.json` (the `baseId` setting)
2. **Get the API key** using the priority order above
3. **Use the Airtable API** to make changes
4. **ALWAYS run `effortless build`** from project root to regenerate all code — every time Airtable schema or data is modified, a build must follow

## Adding a Field to a Table

```bash
# 1. Get table schema to find table ID
curl -s "https://api.airtable.com/v0/meta/bases/{BASE_ID}/tables" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_KEY}" | jq '.tables[] | {id, name}'

# 2. Add the field
curl -s -X POST "https://api.airtable.com/v0/meta/bases/{BASE_ID}/tables/{TABLE_ID}/fields" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "FieldName",
    "type": "singleLineText",
    "description": "Field description"
  }'

# 3. Regenerate code
effortless build
```

## Common Airtable Field Types
- `singleLineText` - short text
- `multilineText` - long text
- `number` - numeric values
- `checkbox` - boolean
- `singleSelect` - dropdown
- `multipleSelects` - multi-select
- `date` - date only
- `dateTime` - date and time
- `email` - email address
- `url` - URL
- `formula` - calculated field (CANNOT be created/modified via API)
- `multipleRecordLinks` - foreign key relationship

## Modifying an Existing Field

```bash
curl -s -X PATCH "https://api.airtable.com/v0/meta/bases/{BASE_ID}/tables/{TABLE_ID}/fields/{FIELD_ID}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "NewFieldName",
    "description": "Updated description"
  }'
```

## Creating a New Table

```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://api.airtable.com/v0/meta/bases/{BASE_ID}/tables" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "TableName",
    "description": "Table description",
    "fields": [
      {"name": "Name", "type": "singleLineText"},
      {"name": "Status", "type": "singleSelect", "options": {"choices": [{"name": "Active"}, {"name": "Inactive"}]}}
    ]
  }'
```

## When the Airtable API can't do something

Some operations (like creating or modifying formula fields) aren't exposed by
the Airtable API. When you hit one in an Airtable-connected project, surface
the blocker and let the user pick a path — don't silently switch to editing
generated files (those edits get overwritten on the next build, so the
apparent fix would evaporate).

Options to present, in order of preference:

1. **Rulebook-direct** — edit `effortless-rulebook.json` to add the formula/lookup field, then `effortless build`. The default for any non-Airtable project, and usually the most ergonomic path even for Airtable projects: the rulebook is JSON, LLMs edit it well, no Playwright/OMNI involved. (If the project is Airtable-connected, follow with a reverse-sync via `push-to-airtable/` so Airtable stays mirrored.)
2. **OMNI via Playwright** — for changes that genuinely need to flow through Airtable first, see `effortless-airtable-omni`.
3. **Airtable UI** — user makes the change manually in Airtable, then runs `effortless build`.
4. **Customization file** — appropriate for SQL that the hub can't model (auth, RLS helpers); not the right fit for a calculated business field.

Wait for direction before proceeding.
