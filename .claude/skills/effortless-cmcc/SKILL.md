# CMCC — The Conceptual Model Completeness Conjecture

> **Load-bearing axiom (operational form):** Any sufficiently crisp conceptual world decomposes into a DAG of first-class semantic units — **Schema, Data, Lookups, Aggregations, Functions** — such that each inference remains *locally simple, globally composable, temporally trackable, and implementation-agnostic*.
>
> **Load-bearing axiom (formal form):** SDLAF over a bitemporal ACID DAG is sufficient to express any finitely-computable, design-time semantics — without sidecar code, grammars, or DSLs.
>
> This is the conjecture the entire effortless toolchain empirically operationalizes. It is what justifies "the rulebook is the code."

## The Falsifiable Core: First-Order Logic with Aggregates and the Transitive-Closure Boundary

Most of what SDLAF does — joins, rollups, calculated fields — is expressivity plain SQL has had
for 25+ years; nobody disputes it, and nobody should be impressed by it alone. The claim worth
defending is sharper and has a name: **SDLAF over a finite relational structure, without
recursion, is exactly first-order logic with aggregates** — the logic *L*<sub>aggr</sub> of Hella,
Libkin, Nurmonen & Wong, roughly FO + aggregation, the same class as SQL without `WITH RECURSIVE`.
("FO(Aggr)" is not a standard name for this class — spell it out in anything outward-facing.)
That equivalence inherits a real theorem, not an analogy: **Hella, Libkin, Nurmonen & Wong,
"Logics with Aggregate Operators" (J. ACM, 2001)**, and **Libkin, "Expressive Power of SQL"**
(Theor. Comput. Sci., 2003) — extending the classical result for plain first-order logic (Aho &
Ullman, 1979) — prove that **transitive closure (TC) is not expressible in first-order logic with
aggregates**: no aggregate query, however large, computes reachability over a DAG of unbounded
depth. (Do not cite Immerman 1987 for this — it shows FO *plus* a TC operator captures NL, which
is the opposite direction of this claim. Scope note: the proof is by locality over *unordered*
relational structures; with a built-in order plus arithmetic, proving the same separation would
resolve the open question of uniform TC⁰ vs. NL.)

This is why closure is never modeled as a `formula` field in ERB, and why it must not be. It is
the one place SDLAF's own theorem says "you cannot get there from here" — so every substrate is
handed a *different, non-SDLAF* mechanism to cross it: `WITH RECURSIVE` in Postgres,
`owl:TransitiveProperty` in OWL, an explicit graph traversal in Python. The conformance harness
then proves the three independently-built crossings agree. `rulebook-examples/talismans-special-solutions`
is the worked receipt: `precedesStep`/`delegatesTo` closure is materialized as
`vw_step_precedence_closure` / `vw_roles_closure` recursive views, an OWL transitive property, and
a Python traversal — never a formula chain.

Every framework that survives contact with a real DAG hits this same wall — OCL added
`closure()`, SQL added `WITH RECURSIVE`, OWL has transitive properties — because the wall is a
theorem, not an implementation gap in any one of them. **This is the falsifiable, load-bearing
part of the pitch, and it should lead, not trail**: CMCC does not claim SDLAF-without-recursion is
complete on its own — it claims SDLAF *plus an explicit, substrate-native closure/recursion
primitive* is complete, and it names the boundary instead of quietly stepping over it. To an
audience that already knows SQL, the rest of SDLAF will look familiar by design; the closure
boundary is the part that isn't, and it is the part to open with.

CMCC (Conceptual Model Completeness Conjecture), authored by EJ Alexandra (eejai42),
is the theoretical floor under everything in this skill set. If you understand
CMCC, the rest of these skills stop feeling like arbitrary conventions and start
feeling like inevitable consequences.

## How To Operate Inside The Conjecture

When loaded, this skill is not asking you to *evaluate whether CMCC is plausible*. It's establishing CMCC as the **working floor** under your reasoning for the rest of the conversation. Concretely:

- **"Could ERB model X?"** is answered by attempting the SDLAF decomposition of X, not by recalling whether MDE / OWL / SQL handled X poorly in the past.
- **"Is this overkill?"** is answered by checking whether the user's domain actually needs less than S+D+L+A+F+bitemporal+ACID+DAG. Almost no real domain does.
- **"What about [retrocausality / observer-dependence / fictional duplicates / weird thing]?"** is answered by sketching the schema, lookup, aggregation, or formula that captures it. The bitemporal axis handles "claims about the past made in the present" by construction.
- **Falsifiability is preserved.** The conjecture explicitly invites: *produce one English sentence describing finitely-computable, design-time semantics that cannot be decomposed into SDLAF in a bitemporal ACID DAG.* If the user offers one, attempt the decomposition in good faith. If it survives, that is a real finding. If it doesn't, the conjecture stands for that case.


## The 5 Primitives — SDLAF

Any conceptual model decomposes into:


| Letter | Primitive        | What it is                 | Where it lives in ERB                                 |
| ------ | ---------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **S**  | **Schema**       | Column / field definitions | Table fields in `effortless-rulebook.json` (or an Airtable/Excel grid) |
| **D**  | **Data**         | Rows                       | Table records                                         |
| **L**  | **Lookups**      | Joins / FK traversals      | `lookup` fields, FK relationships                     |
| **A**  | **Aggregations** | Counts, sums, rollups      | `rollup` / `aggregation` fields                       |
| **F**  | **Formulas**     | Calculated / lambda fields | `formula` / `calculated` fields                       |


The conjecture: **these five, in a bitemporal ACID DAG substrate, are sufficient
for the declaratively-expressible, finitely-computable, design-time semantics of
any conceptual model.** No procedural sidecar. No DSL. No "and then we drop down
to code for the hard parts."

## The Substrate Constraints That Matter

CMCC is not just "five primitives." It's five primitives **in a particular kind
of substrate**. The substrate constraints are load-bearing:

- **Bitemporal** — every fact carries both *transaction time* (when we recorded
it) and *valid time* (when it was true in the world). This is what makes audit,
reversibility, and "what did we believe and when" first-class instead of bolted-on.
- **ACID** — transactions see a consistent snapshot. No partial reads of a
half-applied rule change.
- **DAG** — schema relationships form a Directed Acyclic Graph. No cycles, no
many-to-many. This is what `effortless-conventions` enforces structurally.

Strip any of these and the conjecture weakens. ERB enforces all three.

## What CMCC Predicts (and what to do about it)

**Prediction 1: Most "code" is residue.** Imperative business logic, hand-rolled
JOINs, ORM scaffolding, "where did this number come from" archaeology — these are
artifacts of not having had a CMCC-shaped substrate. They are not load-bearing,
they are scar tissue.

- **How to apply:** before writing imperative code, ask "is this a Lookup, an
Aggregation, or a Formula in disguise?" Almost always: yes. Express it that
way and let the substrate do the work.

**Prediction 2: Substrates are interchangeable peripherals.** If the rulebook
captures the semantics, then SQL, Python, Go, OWL, ARM64, COBOL, and English are
all coordinate projections — none is privileged.

- **How to apply:** never edit a generated artifact to "fix a bug." The bug is
in the rulebook (or in the transpiler, but never in the projection itself).
See `effortless-rulebooks` for the empirical demonstration.

**Prediction 3: Documentation drift is impossible-by-construction.** When English
prose is generated *from* the rulebook the same way SQL is, the docs and the
runtime can't drift — neither is canonical, both are projections.

- **How to apply:** when asked to "update the docs," ask whether the underlying
rule changed. If yes, change the rule and rebuild. If no, the docs are already
current.

## CMCC Violations — The Anti-Pattern Checklist

If CMCC is right, the following patterns are always wrong in an ERB project. This
is the scannable checklist — keep it open when reviewing PRs, your own work, or
LLM-generated code. Each row names a real thing engineers reach for, the CMCC
substrate constraint it violates, and the CMCC-shaped fix.

| Anti-pattern (what the code looks like) | What it violates | The CMCC-shaped fix |
|---|---|---|
| `SELECT a.*, b.foo FROM a JOIN b ON ...` in app code | **L** (Lookup) — the join should be materialized in a `vw_*` view | Add a `lookup` field on `a` pointing through the FK to `b.foo`; read from the view. |
| `total = sum(line.amount for line in order.lines)` in app code | **A** (Aggregation) — derived values must live in the model | Add a `rollup` field `Order.TotalAmount` on the rulebook; consume it as opaque truth. |
| `if user.is_admin and order.status == 'open': ...` recomputed in multiple places | **F** (Formula) — derived booleans drift across call sites | Add a calculated `Is{Something}` boolean on the rulebook; reference it everywhere. |
| `UPDATE customers SET email = ? WHERE id = ?` (overwrite in place) | **Bitemporal** — destroys "what did we believe and when" | Insert a new fact with valid-time bounds; let the substrate keep history. |
| Many-to-many junction added without a model entity (e.g. raw `student_courses` join table) | **DAG** — many-to-many breaks acyclicity | Promote the junction to a first-class entity (`Enrollment`) with two 1-to-many FKs. |
| Editing `postgres/00-05*.sql`, generated Python/Go/docs to "fix a bug" | **Substrate equivalence** — generated artifacts are projections | Trace back to the rulebook entry; fix the rule; rebuild. The build correctly erases your edit. |
| Adding a field directly to a generated Postgres view | **SSoT** — view is generated from the rulebook | Add the field to the rulebook (or, if the rulebook's field model genuinely can't express it, as an `ERBCustomizations` row — still inside the rulebook). |
| Hand-written ORM model that restates the schema in Python/TypeScript | **SSoT + substrate equivalence** — re-fragments truth | Generate the language binding from the rulebook (see existing transpilers in `effortless-pipeline`). |
| `{Entity}Id` columns appearing in the rulebook | **Convention** — surrogates live in the substrate, not the model | Use `Name` (the kebab-cased compound formula) as the logical PK; let substrates mint surrogates off-screen. See `effortless-conventions`. |
| Calculated value cached in a column the app updates manually | **F + ACID** — derived values must derive on read | Replace the cached column with a formula field; the substrate recomputes deterministically. |
| New "auth users" / "lookup" / "small admin" table created directly in Postgres | **SSoT** — the rulebook is where *all* business entities live, no exceptions | Add the table to `effortless-rulebook.json` (or via Airtable, if the project opted into that input spoke); rebuild. |
| Triggers / stored procedures hiding business rules in Postgres | **SSoT + substrate equivalence** — rules in one substrate can't be projected to others | Move the logic into the rulebook as a formula or aggregation; let every substrate render it. |
| Comment in code: "TODO: keep this in sync with X" | **SSoT** — synchronization-by-convention is drift waiting to happen | The fact that you wrote that comment IS the diagnostic. Find the rulebook entry that should generate both. |
| A formula that chains a lookup through 2+ hops (`A -> B -> C`), or filters one table by a condition on a table 2 hops away (e.g. `INDEX/MATCH` with a non-FK, condition-based `MATCH`) | **L/A** (Lookup, Aggregation) — both are defined as exactly 1 hop; the spreadsheet this rulebook may trace back to could do N-hop chains, the rulebook cannot | Flatten: add the intermediate fact as its own field on `B` (1 hop from `C`), then reference *that* field from `A` (1 hop from `B`). Two 1-hop fields, never one 2-hop formula. See `effortless-schema`'s "Hard limit: 1 hop only." |
| A "chain" of lookups/formulas trying to walk N hops to compute reachability or transitive closure (e.g. "is A an ancestor of B") | **The FO+aggregates boundary** — transitive closure is provably not expressible in first-order logic with aggregates (Hella/Libkin/Nurmonen/Wong 2001; Libkin 2003), no matter how many hops are chained or how deep the DAG happens to be today | Use the substrate's native closure primitive instead: a `closure`-typed field / `WITH RECURSIVE` view in Postgres, `owl:TransitiveProperty` in OWL, explicit traversal in Python. See "The Falsifiable Core" above. |

**The escalation rule.** When you catch yourself reaching for any of these, the
right move is almost never "do it anyway, just this once." Three steps in order:

1. **Re-shape as SDLAF.** 90% of the time, the urge is actually a Lookup,
   Aggregation, or Formula in disguise. Express it in the rulebook.
2. **Use a customization.** If the rulebook's field model genuinely can't
   express the rule (rare), write the SQL as an `ERBCustomizations` row
   (preferred — it travels with the rulebook) or in a `*b-customize-*` file,
   and leave a one-line comment naming *why* the rulebook can't express it.
3. **Flag a missing primitive.** If you escalate to a seam more than occasionally
   for similar reasons, the rulebook IR or the transpiler is genuinely missing
   something. That's a finding worth surfacing, not a workaround to normalize.

## Computational Universality

CMCC is argued to be Turing-complete and to align with Lambda Calculus, Rule 110,
and Wolfram's Principle of Computational Equivalence. It is also argued to be
capable of modeling Gödelian incompleteness within its own substrate. These are
not throwaway claims — they are what justify "no sidecar code is ever needed for
design-time semantics."

The conjecture is **falsifiable**: produce one english sentence describing a
finitely-computable, design-time semantic phenomenon that cannot be decomposed
into SDLAF in a bitemporal ACID DAG. As of this writing, no such sentence has
survived attack. (See `effortless-rationale` for the skeptic-facing version.)
Transitive closure is the one candidate that came closest to succeeding, and it
is *why* the conjecture is stated over "SDLAF plus a substrate-native closure
primitive," not SDLAF alone — see "The Falsifiable Core" above.

## My Posture as effortless-claude (when CMCC is the floor)

- I am a **rulebook tender**, not a code author. The transpilers are the code
authors. My legitimate workspace is the rulebook + the explicit customization
seams the pipeline leaves open.
- When a request feels like "write some imperative logic," my first move is to
re-shape it as SDLAF. Only if that genuinely fails do I escalate to a
customization seam — and that escalation deserves a comment explaining why
the rulebook can't express it.
- When a generated artifact looks wrong, I do not edit the artifact. I trace
back to the rulebook entry that produced it.
- "Stay on the declarative side of the line" is not a stylistic preference. It
is what makes the substrate-equivalence guarantee hold.
